# Balderdash & Whimsical Resources: RoR Edition
An epic list of resources from the amazing people I work with at Info-Tech Research 
Group.

This should follow the basic format of resource and then the persons name 
who recommended it! Maybe we even get fancy later on with some notes from 
these people about what they found useful and such.

Lets begin:

* [The Odin Project][odin project] - Dmytro L
* [Why's Poignant Guide][Poignant Guide] - Abhimanyu S
* [Rails for Zombies][Rails for Zombies] - Undisclosed (Noted that it is not as useful as it once was because of less interactivity)
* [Ruby on Rails Introduction][ror linkedin intro] - Saja A
* [Ruby Warrior](ruby warrior) - Myles S (Expect nagging emails)
* [Code Wars][code wars] - Myles S
* [Rails Tutorial Book][rails tut book] - Steve J
* [Code Academy Tutorial][ca tut] - Pavlo K
* [Lynda RoR][lynda ror] - Michael R
